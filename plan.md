## Implementation Plan

### 1. Complete Terminal UI Framework

#### 1.1. Integrate Ratatui (tui-rs) Framework

The current CLI interface is functional but basic. We need to integrate a full terminal UI framework to provide a richer debugging experience:

```rust
// TODO: Add TUI integration with Ratatui
pub fn create_tui_app() -> AppResult<()> {
    // Initialize terminal
    let mut terminal = init_terminal()?;
    
    // Create app state
    let mut app = App::new();
    
    // Main loop
    while app.running {
        // Draw the UI
        terminal.draw(|f| ui::draw(f, &app))?;
        
        // Handle events
        if handle_events(&mut app)? {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Update state
        update(&mut app);
    }
    
    // Restore terminal
    restore_terminal()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 1.2. Implement UI Panels

Create separate panels for different aspects of the debugging experience:

1. Source code panel with syntax highlighting
2. Variables panel with collapsible structures
3. Call stack panel with function navigation
4. Watches panel with expression results
5. Breakpoint panel for managing breakpoints

#### 1.3. Event Handling System

Implement keyboard shortcuts and event handling for interactive debugging:

- Function key mappings for common debugging operations
- Mouse support for breakpoint toggling
- Context menus for variable inspection

### 2. Complete Debug Information Integration

#### 2.1. Implement DWARF Support

Integrate with DWARF debug information to improve source tracking and variable inspection:

```rust
// TODO: Add DWARF debug info support
pub fn load_debug_info(executable_path: &Path) -> DbugResult<DebugInfo> {
    let file = File::open(executable_path)?;
    let mmap = unsafe { memmap2::Mmap::map(&file)? };
    
    let object = object::File::parse(&*mmap)?;
    let endian = if object.is_little_endian() {
        gimli::LittleEndian
    } else {
        gimli::BigEndian
    };
    
    // Load DWARF sections
    let debug_info = DebugInfo::from_object(object, endian)?;
    
    Ok(debug_info)
}
```

#### 2.2. Symbol Table Management

Create a comprehensive symbol table for function and variable lookup:

```rust
// TODO: Implement symbol table management
pub struct SymbolTable {
    pub functions: HashMap<String, FunctionInfo>,
    pub variables: HashMap<String, VariableInfo>,
    pub types: HashMap<String, TypeInfo>,
}

impl SymbolTable {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            functions: HashMap::new(),
            variables: HashMap::new(),
            types: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn add_function(&mut self, name: &str, info: FunctionInfo) {
        self.functions.insert(name.to_string(), info);
    }
    
    // Additional methods for symbol lookup
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations

#### 3.1. Implement Caching System

Add caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance:

```rust
// TODO: Implement caching system
pub struct Cache<K, V> where K: Eq + Hash, V: Clone {
    data: HashMap<K, (V, Instant)>,
    ttl: Duration,
}

impl<K, V> Cache<K, V> where K: Eq + Hash, V: Clone {
    pub fn new(ttl: Duration) -> Self {
        Self {
            data: HashMap::new(),
            ttl,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn get(&self, key: &K) -> Option<V> {
        if let Some((value, time)) = self.data.get(key) {
            if time.elapsed() < self.ttl {
                return Some(value.clone());
            }
        }
        None
    }
    
    pub fn insert(&mut self, key: K, value: V) {
        self.data.insert(key, (value, Instant::now()));
    }
    
    pub fn clear_expired(&mut self) {
        self.data.retain(|_, (_, time)| time.elapsed() < self.ttl);
    }
}
```

#### 3.2. Optimize Memory Usage

Implement strategies to reduce memory overhead during debugging sessions:

- Use smart pointers for shared data
- Implement lazy loading for large data structures
- Add memory pool for temporary allocations

### 4. Implement Async Rust Support

#### 4.1. Future Instrumentation

Add support for instrumenting async functions and futures:

```rust
// TODO: Implement async instrumentation
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn dbug_async(_attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    // Parse the input function
    let mut input_fn = parse_macro_input!(item as ItemFn);
    
    // Check if the function is async
    let is_async = input_fn.sig.asyncness.is_some();
    
    if !is_async {
        // Return an error if the function is not async
        let error = Error::new(
            Span::call_site(),
            "dbug_async can only be used on async functions",
        );
        return TokenStream::from(error.to_compile_error());
    }
    
    // Add instrumentation...
    // Similar to dbug but with additional async-aware instrumentation
    
    input_fn.to_token_stream().into()
}
```

#### 4.2. Async Context Tracking

Implement mechanisms to track async execution context for proper debugging:

- Task identifiers for async tasks
- Context switching detection
- Continuation tracking for futures
